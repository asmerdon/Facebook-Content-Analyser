E-Tims@ETimsNet·Jul 11,"The Sun broke the ‘story’ about an unnamed BBC presenter. Nothing at all initiated by social media. 
The Sun has been out of control for a very long time and @BBCNews are getting worse by the week. There’s yir story Kaye, why is the Sun & @BBCScotlandNews so shite?"
Steven Barnett@stevenjbarnett·Jul 10,"Unbelievable. 12 minutes at top of @bbcnews at 10, featuring 5 ""unanswered"" questions for the BBC - and not a single question for the Sun. This isn't just self-flagellation, it's lousy self-indulgent journalism. 
Better to watch @SkyNews for impartial coverage."
Les Floyd@Lesism·22h,"#BBCNews have verified the #BBCPresenter's phone was used to send threatening messages to a second youngster they met on a 'dating app'.

It suggests a truth to the first story.

Maybe nobody's going to be named, but someone's going to get sacked."

BBC release statement advising that they’ve suspended the presenter alleged to have paid for explicit photos of a 17 year old 

Nothing on BBC News though which is very strange given their history of giving extensive coverage to high profile suspensions "

Neil Wallis@neilwallis1·6h,"Very worrying for @BBCnews et al bosses that different BBC presenters are now ending up rowing at loggerheads over what their fellow BBC presenter caught up in the sex pix scandal should do next, with @theJeremyVine and @richardpbacon publicly taking very different stances."
JoaniWalshi@WalshiJoani·Jul 9,"Hey @bbcnews, how can you be trusted to report on this impartially if you employ @the__chez carrying water for a violent criminal who’s just incited violence towards women? Answer this yourself @the__chez…"
Benny Blanco@Benny_Blanco40·23h,It’s funny watching the BBC talking about the BBC as if they’re not the BBC.
Matthew Todd @MrMatthewTodd·Jul 10,The media are putting us in immense danger by not putting this at the top of their agenda. Editors should be fired and we should start again. @bbcnews @itvnews @skynews @thetimes @DailyMailUK @TheSun @BBCr4today @BBCNewsnight are failing

These #pedophiles are rampant because @BBCNews #bbcpresenter @BegbiesTrnGroup cover up for vile sexual predators.

Client & #rapist #OWENOYSTON employed #MaxClifford a sex fiend to cover up for a sex fiend!
